		The Fellowship is a competitive grant awarded to graduate students at KAUST. The grant consisted of direct research costs and living expenses. Under the Professor \href{https://www.paulamoraga.com/}{Dr. Paula Moraga}'s supervision, I have been working on the development of innovative statistical methods for geospatial data analysis with applications in health surveillance.
		
		\item \textbf{Undergraduate Scholarship}, by Brazil's ``Science without Borders'' Program. From 07/2016 to 12/2017.
		
		The Scholarship was granted to excellent students from Brazil who wanted to complete part of their undergraduate education in other Educational Institutions overseas. It covered tuition and living expenses. I completed the program as a student at Curtin University (Australia).

	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Three-week visiting period at University College London (England) under \href{https://sites.google.com/site/fjavierrubio67/}{Dr. Javier Rubio}'s supervision. 10/2022.
		
		During this time, we worked on the development of a general class of statistical models (along with inference tools) for survival data analysis. In particular, we modeled the hazard function for cancer-diagnosed patients assuming unknown causes of death (also known as ``relative survival framework'') and spatial autocorrelation.

			\item Module 9: Contact Network Epidemiology.
			\item Module 12: Statistics and Modeling with Novel Data Streams.
		\end{enumerate}
		
		\item València International Bayesian Analysis Summer School, 4${}^{\text{th}}$ Edition (VIBASS4). 07/2021.
		
		\item Duke Machine Learning Virtual Summer School 2021. 06/2021.
